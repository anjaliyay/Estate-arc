# EstateArc

Users of EstateArc's sleek and contemporary real estate website may quickly search for and sort properties by name. A seamless user experience is provided through the usage of Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity CMS in the development of the website.

Each property has a separate website with comprehensive information on it, including pictures, its location on a Google Map, and any pertinent information broken down into categories. Whether a user is surfing on a laptop or a mobile device, the website's user-friendly interface (UI) makes it easy for them to find the information they need.


Sanity CMS powers the backend of EstateArc, making it simple for administrators to maintain and change the website's content. Administrators can swiftly add or amend property listings with its user-friendly interface.
